            <h2>High On Life</h2>
            <p>Jabari is the classic stoner type yet seems to access a lot of his art inspiration through his
                time inebriated. He likes to hang out with his friends, go to parties, but also spend time one
                on one time with people he cares about. He could be described as an ambivert in many ways, being
                both a social butterfly but also one who enjoys the downtime.</p>

                black suit, sunglasses, a large afro and a booming personality. He portrays his art as

            <h4>The Gang</h4>
            <p>Jabari has two main homies, Jimmy, who doubles as his weed dealer, and Ky, who is
                slightly confusing but overall, super chill homie as well. Together they get up to no
                good, go to parties, converse and tell crazy stories from their past, and more than
                anything, smoke A LOT of weed. Other friends include Downtown Pat, a homeless bmx biker
                with a ton of emotion and a lot of problems.</p>
