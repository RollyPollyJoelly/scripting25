                    <div class="col-sm-3 gx-5">

                        <p>In day-to-day life, his time is consumed by DJing, music production and social media
                            management. He runs a DJ collective and event promotion company and though it may seem as a
                            meticulous job, he rarely views it as work and more so a thoroughly
                            enjoyed hobby. These hobbies are what inspired him to take on the Multimedia Production
                            program at Lethbridge Polytechnic, with web design and sound design clearly and directly
                            tied to many of his classes this semester. In high school he lacked motivation, however
                            he also had extreme undiagnosed ADHD (he would have loved to know that at the time), which
                            made it difficult to prosper in most classes.
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3 gx-5">
                        <p>
                            Outside of work and school, he comes from a massive family. Directly he had only one younger
                            brother, however his 5 uncles and 10 aunties on his momâ€™s side have given him many, MANY
                            cousins. His family was spread out across the globe, from B.C. all the way to Japan, and
                            then to Argentina, culture ran deep within his family. He is not currently a part of any
                            sports team, but if you have seen him, you would be correct in assuming he had played
                            basketball in the past. He has travelled quite a bit, but his all-time favourite place he
                            has visited would be Europe in general. The electronic scene there is like no
                            other.</p>

                    <div class="col-sm-3 gx-5">
                        <p> A quick story about him that he will forever enjoy telling would be the first time he
                            performed as a DJ for 5000 people, while being completely unaware there was that many
                            people.
                            The crowd was loud, so loud that it felt as if the loop earplugs he was wearing were not
                            even in. He got
                            on stage, neon lights, lasers, and smoke billowing out from beneath him. He looked
                            out across the clearing that the rave had been set on and saw nothing but eyes lighting up
                            as they looked upon him. He nearly had a panic attack. He shook as he inserted his USB. He took a deep breath and went on to play probably one of the worst sets of his
                            life.</div>

                                <p> The story of GHOOLY continues to go strong, with all kinds of gigs and areas of networking to be done. You can catch him spinning for CKXU's "House of Crimson" as well as his personal passion project "Drop Culture" where he hosts shows focused on different genres at unique locations throughout the city. He hopes that this site has grabbed your attention and that you will join alongside his journey to wherever his passion may take him...<br></br>
